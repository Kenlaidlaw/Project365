I am a beginner programmer about half way through learning the basics of JS having covered the basics of HTML and CSS.

This programme is my first attempt to create an app outside of a tutorial, I plan to work on this for a minimum of 30 minutes a day every day of this year or if I complete this project the next project on my list.

Each day I will load the project progress onto Github.  Outside of this I will be completing the design elements, this New Years resolution is purely focused on the process of making the app work rather than how it looks.

The Project itself is a high level work planner.  You will allocate how many hours you have available in a week to complete or work towards your goals.  You can then break that down further as it will allow you to allocate a number of hours per week for different tasks that you want to achieve.
e.g guitar 3 hours, study 10 hours, programming 15 hours

It counts down from a max number of hours you have set as available each week and allows you to plan your week in a more flexible manner than a strict timetable allowing you to fit your goals in around your lifestyle and when you feel best able to set some time aside for them.

I'd like to also include a pomodora timer and expect ideas for this to develop as it progresses.  This is a project I would like for myself to use so that I can fit in my busy life while still achieving my goals while understanding my time limits while setting them.


Day 1 - Setting up files Github and this readme.  First challenge is to work out how to take an input in a form and then use it to work out a number for display elsewhere.
Day 2 - Learnt how to get two variables to be input and then use them to display another figure on the page
Day 3 - Set up a practice page rather than the bottom of the existing index and looked at implementing what I learned yesterday to work out hours available.  Tomorrow I think will need to be focused on psuedo code and a better idea of what this needs to cover.
Day 4 -
